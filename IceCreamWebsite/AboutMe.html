  <P> <br>Hi !! My name is Kelley Montejo. Iâ€™m 18 and an incoming college Freshman majoring in Computer Science at the New York Institute of Technology. I am intrested in coding, Cyber Secuirty and technology in general. I love to volunteer, some foundations I have volunteered are with, West Side Campaign Against Hunger, Prospect Park Alliance, New York Cares, and GLAMOURgals.
