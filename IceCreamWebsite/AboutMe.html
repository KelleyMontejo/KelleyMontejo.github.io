      <p>
         Hi !! I'm Kelley Montejo. Iâ€™m an incoming college freshman majoring in Computer Science at the New York Institute of Technology. I enjoy volunteering and am interested in coding, cybersecurity, and technology in general. Some of my hobbies include playing volleyball, crocheting, spending time with family/friends, and watching movies/shows. In the future, I hope to expand my coding skills and explore the field of cybersecurity.

          <p>The waffle cone was invented by accident at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair by a Syrian concessionaire named Ernest Hamwi. He was selling a waffle-like pastry called zalabis when an ice cream vendor ran out of dishes. Hamwi rolled one of his waffles into a cone shape, creating a new way to serve ice cream.
